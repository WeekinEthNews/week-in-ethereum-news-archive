###### **Ethereum News and Links**

**Layer 1**

- \[eth1\] [Eth1 roadmap q&a](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eth-roadmap-ama-webinar-feb-6th-8am-pst-1700-utc-1/2518/2) video and notes
- \[eth1\] Alexey Akhunov on the [Eth1 workshop](https://medium.com/@akhounov/looking-back-at-the-ethereum-1x-workshop-26-28-01-2019-part-1-70c1ebd93266), and parts [two](https://medium.com/@akhounov/looking-back-at-the-ethereum-1x-workshop-26-28-01-2019-part-2-d3d8fdcede10) and [three](https://medium.com/@akhounov/looking-back-at-the-ethereum-1x-workshop-26-28-01-2019-part-3-cc162ca04e9f)
- \[eth2\] eth2 [spec v0.2](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/releases/tag/v0.2.0).
- \[eth2\] [Vitalik](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/alpwlx/today_marks_the_very_first_eth20_version_release/efgov9n/): “If you followed the 1.0 release process back in 2014-15, the spec is arguably more significant than a testnet”
- \[eth2\] Soleimani/Slipper/Tsui [report on Eth2 implementation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PS0k9MaKPdPwEw3Uh9rq7USjq7LcSpT6ICQUXRij4YE/edit#heading=h.tptc9denl7ak) sparked lots of chat.
- \[eth2\] Ben Edgington responded to this report in [What’s New in Eth2](https://notes.ethereum.org/c/Sk8Zs--CQ/https%3A%2F%2Fbenjaminion.xyz%2Fnewineth2%2F20190208.html): “It's not wrong, it just kind of misses the point…. Rather than throwing in the towel by reverting to old-school ways of working, I would dearly love to see more good thinking on how we might do decentralisation better. There is certainly scope for doing better, this I do agree with.”
- \[eth2\] [Justin Drake](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/anji4w/the_state_of_ethereum_20/efwo25w/?context=3#eftwwhc) on Eth2 timelines: “2019, 2020, 2021 for phases 0, 1, 2 respectively.”
- \[eth2\] More [Justin](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/anji4w/the_state_of_ethereum_20/efwo25w/?context=3#efwh4az): “Phase 1 is significantly simpler than both phases 0 and 2. I expect it to come relatively soon after phase 0. Phase 1 can provide scaling by being the data availability layer for L2 execution engines…. The hard part of phase 1 is getting libp2p/gossipsub production-ready.” Parts of phase 1 and 2 are being worked on in parallel with phase 0.
- \[eth2\] Speaking of phase 1 networking: [Why libp2p](https://medium.com/paritytech/why-libp2p-13085ed0c9c8)? a networking layer explainer from Parity
- \[eth2\] Vitalik is [bullish on the Eth2 roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1093736438808510464): “My latest position is that the current quadratic beacon chain architecture is all we'll need for a long long time. Maybe forever.”
- \[eth2\] More on what’s in the Eth2 roadmap in the latest [Eth2 implementer call notes](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-pm/blob/master/eth2.0-implementers-calls/call_011.md)
- \[eth2\] Logic and economics around [how long to process a stake withdrawal](https://ethresear.ch/t/rate-limiting-entry-exits-not-withdrawals/4942)
- \[eth2\] [Lighthouse](https://lighthouse.sigmaprime.io/update-07.html) dev update. Sets expectations for q1 testnet: cross-client public testnet, may only be short-lived. This update was particularly readable even for non-Eth2 experts
- \[eth2\] [Yeeth](https://medium.com/yeeth/yeeth-updates-1-5474eb78c319) dev update
- \[eth2\] Rocketpool has a [beacon chain simulator](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/development-update-6th-feb-2019-850e6c01657e) they’ll use for a staking pool test, with RPL rewards for testers.
- \[eth2\] Eth2 [implementer workshop notes](https://hackmd.io/8Wka34uPT2unwJoYvkRYew?view) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_ZFdQHivJQ)
- \[eth2\] A short and high level [overview of the Beacon Chain](https://twitter.com/cemozer_/status/1090399936938532864), eth2’s phase 0
