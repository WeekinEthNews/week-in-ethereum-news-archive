We are excited to announce that [Phase One of the Celer State Guardian Network (SGN) mainnet](https://blog.celer.network/2020/11/09/celer-state-guardian-network-launches-on-mainnet/) is now up and running! Staking will start from December 1, 2020. SGN is the last piece of Celer Network’s coherent layer-2 scaling platform. This launch marks another significant milestone of the Celer layer-2 blockchain scaling platform after our [State Channel Network](https://www.celer.network/docs/celercore/index.html), which was successfully launched more than a year ago and supports hundreds of thousands of users today. 

Real money games, such as [Arcade Win](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/arcade-win/id1459895768) and [Daub Cash](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/daub-cash/id1513396754), built using [Celer’s gaming-focused SDK](http://developer.celerx.app/) just reached top #10 ranking in App Store.
