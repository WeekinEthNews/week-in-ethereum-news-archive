- [Beam Sync](https://medium.com/@jason.carver/intro-to-beam-sync-a0fd168be14a): gets all block headers, executes a recent block using the witness and subsequently fills in state as it executes blocks by getting data from peers. From the Trinity team, it can reduce sync time to minutes.

I own 100% Week In Ethereum. Editorial control has always been me.

If you‚Äôre wondering ‚Äú[why didn‚Äôt my post make it into Week in Ethereum](https://www.evanvanness.com/post/179914035841/why-didnt-my-post-make-the-newsletter),‚Äù then here‚Äôs a hint: don‚Äôt email me. Do put it on Reddit.

It‚Äôs amazing to me how many people email me when every issue has a link at the bottom saying not to email me to get in the newsletter.

If you're unhappy with editorial decisions or anything that I have written in this issue, feel free to¬†[tweet at me](https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness).
