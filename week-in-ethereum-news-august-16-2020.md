###### **Eth News and Links**

**Eth1**

- Geth [v1.9.19](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.9.19) includes backrunning patch
- Turbogeth [alpha2](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/turbo-geth/releases/tag/v2020.08.02-alpha) release
- [Adding cross-transaction BLS signature aggregation](https://ethresear.ch/t/adding-cross-transaction-bls-signature-aggregation-to-ethereum/7844) to the EVM

**Eth2**

- Medalla experienced instability this weekend as Prysmatic’s client did not [correctly deal with a Cloudflare outage](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11RmitNRui10LcLCyoXY6B1INCZZKq30gEU6BEg3EWfk/edit#heading=h.d5qpimbr9o7y) and then [local storage got deleted in an emergency hotfix](https://twitter.com/terencechain/status/1294637848029585409). If you’re running Prysm, [update to latest version and restart node](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases/tag/v1.0.0-alpha.22).
    - This is why we testnet - remove unnecessary dependencies like Cloudflare, test failure modes, find bugs.
- This instability showed why Eth2 **needs and incentivizes** client diversity. Here’s some guides to running [Teku (Somer Esat)](https://medium.com/@SomerEsat/guide-to-staking-on-ethereum-2-0-ubuntu-medalla-teku-170e2c52bd23), [Nimbus](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-how-to-stake-on-eth2-with-nimbus) (CoinCashew), [Lighthouse](https://gist.github.com/Larrypcdotcom/fcd4e79c2cf02ce37ec6ed9797beca2c) (larrypc), or [Lodestar](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-how-to-stake-on-eth2-with-lodestar) (CoinCashew).
    - _Editorial reminder: it is a staker’s_ incentivized _duty to run stable clients with minority share of the network_
    - If you’re looking for support as a staker, check out the [Ethstaker subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/) or [their discord](https://discord.com/invite/6fJw9qG).
- [Formally verifying the eth2 spec](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-development/formally-verifying-the-ethereum-2-0-phase-0-specifications/) in Dafny
- [Nimbus client](https://our.status.im/medalla-update/) update on improving attestation efficiency and switching to blst BLS sigs library
- Danny Ryan’s live [demo of eth1 + eth2 merge](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6iW1MeT-Cug%E2%80%A6)

**EIPs/Standards**

- [EIP2878](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/2878): Reduce block reward to 0.5 ETH
- [EIP2872](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/5a883ed1d738b8153ac69dc57146492b2596d646/eip-halvening.md): Reduce block reward to 1 ETH

**Layer2**

- Hermez zk rollup [auction to be block producer](https://blog.hermez.io/proof-of-donation-keeping-hermez-permissionless-and-giving-back-to-the-community/) with proceeds funding public goods
- Celer’s [State Guardian Network testnet launch](https://blog.celer.network/2020/08/10/state-guardian-network-beta-testnet-launches/)
- Livepeer’s [probabilistic micropayments as pseudo-layer2](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/how-are-livepeers-probabilistic-micropayments-holding-up-with-these-ethereum-high-gas-prices/1127)
- ENS [exploring optimistic rollup style](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/improving-gas-efficiency-of-dns-domain-claims-with-optimistic-verification/189) for DNS domain claims
- [Rollup replay protection](https://ethresear.ch/t/zkrollup-optimistic-rollup-replay-protection/6999)
