###### **Eth News and Links**

**Mainnet**

- Geth [v1.10](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/03/03/geth-v1-10-0/) - snap sync is shipped, though not yet enabled as nodes need to build the structure necessary for snap sync. That structure makes pruning relatively quick and gets you back to a database size of a fresh sync. Snapshots also make DOS attacks harder and increase database read capacity of node. Adds eth/66 and will drop eth/64 soon and eth/65 in the summer
- [EIP1559 scheduled for the London hard fork](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/1559-updates/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40timbeiko%2F1559-update-008), likely in July when the difficulty bomb goes off.
