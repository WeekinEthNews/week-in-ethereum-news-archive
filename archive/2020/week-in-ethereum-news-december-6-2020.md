###### **Eth News and Links**

**Eth1**

- Leading game theorist Tim Roughgarden [publishes his positive analysis of 1559](http://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf)
- Latest [eip1559 implementation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dopljpI59Rw&feature=youtu.be) call. [Beiko’s notes](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1334571129671806976), with a path to mainnet
- A [code merkleization explainer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/30/the-1x-files-code-merkleization/)

**Proof of Stake launches successfully**

- The Beacon chain launched, with the first block graffiti reading “Mr F was here” ([beaconscan](https://beaconscan.com/slot/1), [beaconchain](https://beaconcha.in/block/1)) and the network participation rate quickly reaching an astonishing 98-99% ([beaconchain](https://beaconcha.in/charts/participation_rate), [beaconscan](https://beaconscan.com/stat/networkparticipation))
- Meanwhile the deposit contract is [over 1m ETH](https://etherchain.org/account/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa), so now more than 1% of all ETH is locked for staking. That number is only going to go up, right now that puts annual staking rewards at 14.6%. That means the network is [continually increasing its decentralization](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1333738057162362880)
- There have been [3 slashing events](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1334881186003492864), all by stakers (and a pool known as Ankr) running their keys on multiple machines. This was already a known bad idea! Slashing is bad, going offline is very insignificant in comparison
- Before genesis, Prysmatic published [slashing prevention tips](https://medium.com/prysmatic-labs/eth2-slashing-prevention-tips-f6faa5025f50). It emphasized that you should never run your key in multiple places.
- Pre-launch [what’s new in eth2](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_201130)
- Superphiz: hold off on [staking with trusted pools/exchanges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qh4q8B2GSds&feature=youtu.be)

**Proof of Stake plans**

- Latest [eth2 call](https://youtu.be/8mE--yxMZtk?t=23). Notes from [Ben](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/SJphODIiv) and [Mamy](https://gist.github.com/mratsim/d35a5171c52d3b998b492e9512f6cee7)
- Shift [computing costs from end of epoch to mid-epoch](https://hackmd.io/@HWeNw8hNRimMm2m2GH56Cw/HkTzLKOov)

**Layer2**

- Loopring’s [AMM is live on their zkrollup](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/looprings-zkrollup-amm-is-live-2f8251cd0fcd) (though limited to LRC/ETH for now)
- Golem’s latest release uses [Zksync zkrollup for transfers](https://blog.golemproject.net/new-golem-alpha-iii-reveal/)
- Deversifi’s validium (off-chain data held by committee) upgrades to [StarkEx v2](https://medium.com/starkware/starkex-2-0-is-now-live-on-mainnet-d8768b860bd4) which includes fast withdrawals and a Turing-complete STARK proof language, though non-conformant ERC20 tokens (OMG, USDT) won’t [work for another month](https://blog.deversifi.com/a-tale-of-intrigue-non-standard-erc20-tokens-and-platform-upgrades/)
