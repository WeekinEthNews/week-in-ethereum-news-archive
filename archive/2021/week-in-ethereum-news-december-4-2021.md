### **This newsletter is made possible thanks to [NEAR](https://near.org/)!**

![NEAR](https://weekinethereumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/near_logo_stack.jpg)

NEAR has [launched Simple Nightshade sharding](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption/) to pave the way for greater throughput as NEAR reached [50 million transactions](https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol/status/1465643042803572737) this week!

Simple Nightshade has four different state shards.  For devs and users, it’s important to note that NEAR treats cross-contract calls the same regardless of whether two contracts are on the same shard.

Early in 2022, [phase 1 will introduce chunk-only producers](https://near.org/decentralize/), who only validate one shard and allow for further decentralization via more validators.  Full Nightshade is scheduled for q3 2022 and will feature full sharding of both state and processing.

Learn more about what’s going on in NEAR in the community-driven [NEARweek](https://nearweek.com/) newsletter.
