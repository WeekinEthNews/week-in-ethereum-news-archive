![Celer](https://weekinethereumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screenshot-from-2020-11-22-15-36-32.png)

[Celer](http://celer.network/) is a coherent layer-2 scaling platform on Ethereum powered by [Generalized State Channel Network](https://www.celer.network/docs/celercore/index.html) and [Rollup](https://medium.com/celer-network/adding-hybrid-pos-rollup-sidechain-to-celers-coherent-layer-2-platform-d1d3067fe593) technology. 

Celer recently launched [Layer2.finance](https://layer2.finance/), a layer-2 rollup-based DeFi aggregator that acts as a low-cost and trust-free gateway for the users to explore and benefit from the existing DeFi ecosystem with 100X lower cost. Layer2.finance achieves scalability “in-place” with no protocol migration needed and therefore, does not cause liquidity fragmentation or break composability. You can use the app here: [app.l2.finance](https://app.l2.finance/).
