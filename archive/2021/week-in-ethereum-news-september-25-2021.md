### **This newsletter is made possible thanks to [GridPlus](https://gridplus.io/)’s Lattice hardware wallet!**

![GridPlus](https://weekinethereumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/grid-rec-1024x768.jpeg)

What good is a hardware wallet if you can’t be sure of what you’re signing?  

The Lattice is the first and only hardware wallet that _securely_ **shows you a human readable version of an Ethereum transaction**.  Anything else is just security theater.

Just as importantly, the Lattice is the only hardware wallet that is **built to be resistant to physical tampering**.  

We can’t leak your data if we don’t have it: we **never store your name or address even a single day longer** than we have to. 

Isn’t your crypto worth securing?  Buy a [Lattice today](http://www.gridplus.io/?afmc=WeekInEthereumNews).
