###### **Eth News and Links**

**Mainnet execution layer**

- Tim Beiko’s [periodic broader overview of mainnet changes](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/acd): testnets for the July/Aug London upgrade
- Latest [core devs call](https://youtu.be/C9hzAYkklQM?t=244). Notes from [Tim Beiko](https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1385613482402275331): London fork in July/Aug will be eip1559, basefee, bomb delay, and eliminating refunds
- OpenEthereum [postmortem for Berlin consensus bug](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18BhIEB7V_f_GkL8NZptxq-xadu5sb8QUzego8YVVMUM/edit#heading=h.nxtmf7qzhoyo)

**EIPs/Standards**

- [ERC3440](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/3519): NFT editions standard
- [EIP3520](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/8a6f26c5c4929cdbb155fcef2fa5e8ced6d616a7/EIPS/eip-3520.md): transactions destination opcode
- [EIP3529](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/5f9d8ea62033890c848e5b363408c82362bc6bcf/EIPS/eip-3529.md): No SELFDESTRUCT refunds, reduce SSTORE refunds, add a max refund per transaction of 20% of gas used
- [EIP3521](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3521): Reduce access list cost

**Proof of stake consensus layer**

- Our proof of stake network had its first hiccups this week. An issue with eth1data voting and validator deposits led to Prysm nodes being unable to produce blocks. This was relatively minor, leading to an [average of less than a dollar](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/mxpz57/regarding_the_recent_beacon_chain_incident/) of forgone attestations for individual validators.
    - Prysmatic [released a hotfix](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm/releases/tag/v1.3.8-hotfix+6c0942)
- Latest [what’s new in eth2](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/eth2_news/https%3A%2F%2Fhackmd.io%2F%40benjaminion%2Fwnie2_210424): _it is time for everybody to take client diversity seriously_. Ben reflects on the hiccups. **Running the majority client puts your own money at risk, plus everyone else’s**.
- Turning off PoW testnet: [how to setup a multi-client ethereum merge testnet](https://github.com/protolambda/mergenet-tutorial). An ephemeral multi-client testnet is planned for late this upcoming week.
- Nethermind floats [October](https://twitter.com/nethermindeth/status/1385699335355125766) as an aggressive target to turn off PoW
- When we turn off PoW, [staking rewards will likely be multiples higher](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1384124998084792324) than they are now
- Latest [proof of stake implementation](https://youtu.be/D9Aqr8thF9c?t=225) call. Notes from [Alex Stokes](https://twitter.com/ralexstokes/status/1385295236885204997) and [Ben Edgington](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/rJUzAo0Id). The first upgrade (named Altair) may get pushed back a couple weeks, roughly around the London fork upgrade.
- We hit [1 million PoS blocks this week](https://beaconcha.in/block/1000000), the milestone block proposed by Validator\_McValid\_ETH
- [Visualizing Ethereum’s sharded, rollup-centric future](https://barnabe.substack.com/p/eth2?s=09), secured by proof of stake

**Layer2**

- Celer’s [layer2 finance is live](https://blog.celer.network/2021/04/22/the-layer2-finance-v0-1-mainnet-launches-democratize-defi-simple-and-zero-fees/): transfer your DAI, USDC, USDT or BUSD to Celer’s optimistic rollup and then you can deposit gas-free to Aave, Compound or Curve

[Celer](http://celer.network/) recently launched [Layer2.finance](https://app.l2.finance/) on Ethereum mainnet.

Layer2.finance tackles the two biggest challenges preventing DeFi from reaching mass adoption: the extraordinarily high transaction fees and being very difficult to navigate and use. Layer2.finance is a novel solution that allows people to access all existing DeFi protocols at a fraction of the cost by acting like a “[DeFi Public Transportation System](https://blog.celer.network/2021/04/02/eli5-layer2-finance-the-modern-subway-of-the-defi-city/)”. With Celer’s [advanced layer-2 rollup technology](https://blog.celer.network/2021/02/18/layer2-finance-get-defi-mass-adoption-today-scaling-layer-1-defi-in-place-with-zero-migration/), multiple people split the cost of individual layer1DeFi transactions in a completely trust-free and non-custodial way.

Users can use Aave, Compound and Curve now completely for free via layer2.finance.
