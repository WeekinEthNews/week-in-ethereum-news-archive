### **This newsletter is made possible thanks to [NEAR](https://near.org/)!**

![NEAR](https://weekinethereumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/near_logo_stack.jpg)

NEAR has [launched Simple Nightshade sharding](https://near.org/blog/near-launches-nightshade-sharding-paving-the-way-for-mass-adoption/) to pave the way for greater throughput!

Recently [NEAR launched stake farming](https://medium.com/nearprotocol/near-launches-stake-farming-to-unlock-ecosystem-rewards-e09ae94d8218) for apps to work with staking pools to integrate apps’ tokens into their rewards.  The first launch was with Aurora EVM, so you can now stake $NEAR and be paid in $AURORA.

Learn more about what’s going on in NEAR in the community-driven [NEARweek](https://nearweek.com/) newsletter.

**Security**

- [OpenSea uncanceled listings](https://thedefiant.io/opensea-listing-bug/) used to buy NFTs below market rates, listings valid until canceled by a transaction, listing [cancels](https://twitter.com/dingalingts/status/1486654437548773376) are being front run
- Multichain bridge [post mortem](https://media.dedaub.com/phantom-functions-and-the-billion-dollar-no-op-c56f062ae49f), relied on a tokens permit function reverting but WETH doesn’t have permit & the fallback function doesn’t revert

**Ecosystem**

- [Ethereum.org](https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/01/24/the-great-eth2-renaming/) removed all uses of ETH2 terminology, Ethereum is execution layer + consensus layer, renaming doesn’t change Ethereum roadmap
