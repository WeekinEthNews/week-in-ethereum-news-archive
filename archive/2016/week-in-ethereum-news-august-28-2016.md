##   
My Investing Thesis \[Work-In-Progress\]  

How do you make money on the internet?  According to an overused saw, it’s the 3 Ps: [pills, porn, and poker](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.evanvanness.com%2Fpost%2F148220020896%2Fa-scenario-where-ethereum-classic-could-overtake&t=YzQ3MzFlOGE2YWVkZDFjMTUyNjQ3OGY0ZDM3ZTc3NzI2MGExM2YxNyxtaE5CRG9Ieg%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155180529233%2Faugust-28-2016&m=0).

As I quoted Vlad Zamfir in [issue 1](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.evanvanness.com%2Fpost%2F149620900271%2Fwhats-happening-in-ethereum-issue-1-82116&t=YTdjOWI0ZjU4ZWQ4MWZlMDBlMmY3ZmE1NDRiODYwZWM0ZTQwZmZlZixtaE5CRG9Ieg%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155180529233%2Faugust-28-2016&m=0):

- “There’s still technical problems. It doesn’t scale. It’s not efficient. It’s not secure. It sucks, basically. It’s shitty technology.”

Right now, dapps struggle to make it “easy enough” for non-technical end users. The Zamfir quote is not entirely about end users, but it is applicable.  Many are hard at work to abstract away the difficulty for end users to the point that dapp users don’t realize they are using Ethereum.  However, that day is far away.

So what kinds of things have motivated potential customers willing to jump through hoops?  Often things at the margin of society.

**SGD**.  I generalize the 3 Ps as SGD (like the [algorithm](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStochastic_gradient_descent&t=N2RhNTNmMzQwYWY3ODJiNjFjNDRjZTVjNmY2MzRiYjliMjA3YWM5YyxtaE5CRG9Ieg%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155180529233%2Faugust-28-2016&m=0)): sex, gambling, drugs.

_Sex_. I shudder to think what sex-related apps need censorship-proof decentralization, but I haven’t heard of anyone building those on Ethereum.

_Drugs_. Silk Road paved the way for Bitcoin’s (relative) success, though it seems like peer-to-peer marketplace OpenBazaar (ie, not on Ethereum) will likely fill this niche.  To date, I’ve been surprised at the dearth of Ethereum dark markets.

_Gambling_ seems like a fairly natural fit for Ethereum’s early stages.   Even better if we can use [gambling for societal good](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.evanvanness.com%2Fpost%2F130187978661%2Faugur-uber-for-knowledge&t=N2NmNzgwMzYyM2I0MWRjYWE4M2EzM2I2Yzc0MzI5YzJiZWY0MGZiNCxtaE5CRG9Ieg%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155180529233%2Faugust-28-2016&m=0).   

## Did I say Gambling?  I meant Finance.

The difference between gambling, trading, investing, hedging, insurance etc etc is…?

Largely semantic.  It wasn’t that long ago that stock markets were considered gambling.

Speaking of finance…   

## Banks and Ethereum

**CONTEXT:**

“[All the banks are running trials on different flavors of Ethereum. That’s because it is the most advanced and tested smart contracts platform](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.xrpchat.com%2Ftopic%2F1843-ubs-bank-to-accept-ethereum%2F%3F%23comment-16711&t=MzIyZmQ2NDk2YTMyYmY4NzUxMWJmMDlmZTAyMGQyOTM2NDNlYjc1ZixtaE5CRG9Ieg%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155180529233%2Faugust-28-2016&m=0)”

– John Whelan, leader of Banco Santander’s blockchain group

Two big announcements this week

1. UBS, Santander, Deutsche Bank, BNY Mellon and ICAP announced Clearmatics’ “utility settlement coin” which is a token that participating banks will use to try to reduce counterparty risk using a permissioned blockchain. Put differently: the banks will keep a private blockchain between themselves using a token that they can exchange for cash.  This will reduce much of the cost associated with “back office” functions.

    1. Key differences between R3 CEV and Ethereum as I understand them from white paper: (1) no token, (2) code is explicitly subservient to existing governmental law and regulations, (3) private, (4) transactions are independent of each other (stateless), (5) financial contracts only.

_MY TAKE_: Private chains using Ethereum-like technology can only be a good thing, even if they don’t run on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Vitalik’s candid assessment of the fork that almost no one has seen

Vitalik was asked by someone who wants to fork BTC what [lessons they should learn from the ETH fork](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fethereum%2Fcomments%2F4yvmzu%2Fif_another_hard_fork_happened_again_in_the_future%2Fd6rj0oe&t=MTk5MzU2MjI3YTRkOTc4NGY4YWI0ZjRlMTQ1MWViNzY5NjkwOGUzNyxtaE5CRG9Ieg%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155180529233%2Faugust-28-2016&m=0).  Almost no one has seen Vitalik’s comment in response because the post got deleted.

![image](https://66.media.tumblr.com/653bc14ca99302ec6e79dc9354f0b15d/tumblr_inline_oj0ry4ORtV1rxca3y_500.png)

A few observations:

1. If you read between the lines, Vitalik’s assessment shows that he’s pretty candid with himself that the fork did not go quite as expected.  His self-awareness is a good sign for Ethereum’s future.
2. The Foundation has split their ETC.  Have they sold it?
3. He appears to imply that part of ETC’s problem is lack of credibility.  He’s right, and that’s part of why [I dumped my ETC](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.evanvanness.com%2Fpost%2F148442932156%2Fselling-my-ethc-or-how-an-ethereum-anti-forker&t=M2M5MjMyZTUwYmExNTRjNjk5YjNjZmZlOGJjOGVhODA5ZjA5MGZlMixtaE5CRG9Ieg%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155180529233%2Faugust-28-2016&m=0) despite being [against that particular hard fork implementation](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.evanvanness.com%2Fpost%2F147468173531%2Ftis-the-question-to-fork-or-not-to-fork&t=NDczY2FmNGQ3ZTRlMDc3M2E2ODE4YmY4ZDQ5NWQ4NGE0NGEwMTcxZSxtaE5CRG9Ieg%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155180529233%2Faugust-28-2016&m=0).
4. He’s also right that ETC would have done much better if it had (A) dual client ready, (B) decent block explorers, and © solutions for replay attacks. \[Though ETH also should’ve had a solution for replay attacks.\]

## THE Dao Silver Lining: Improved Smart Contract Security

- Researchers from Microsoft, INRIA & Harvard published a paper on outlining a “[framework to analze and formally verify Ethereum smart contracts](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fum%2Fpeople%2Fnswamy%2Fpapers%2Fsolidether.pdf&t=ZjMxY2RjZDdhZmM3YjgxMDhmNGQ2Mjg5ZTYwOWEwN2UxN2NlYTEwZSxtaE5CRG9Ieg%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155180529233%2Faugust-28-2016&m=0).” It’s a relatively limited tool as it couldn’t read much of Solidity’s syntax, yet it could “translate and typecheck 46 out of the 396 contracts” found on the EtherScan block explorer.
    - The scary part? “only a handful” were completely safe per this tool, thus “large scale analysis of published contract is likely to uncover widespread vulnerabilities.”   Maybe. Given the tool’s limitations, I could definitely see a very real possibility that the contracts that their tool analyzed were old or contracts where not much money was at stake.
    - Bottom line: The silver lining to TheDAO is that lots of smart minds have been drawn to making sure that smart contracts can and are written securely.
