- Joe Lubin did a podcast interview where he offered [some interesting thoughts](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fm.soundcloud.com%2Fblockchannelshow%2Fepisode-1-empowering-creativity-with-technology&t=YjY1ZDU2Yjk0YzQ4YjhlZjNiZGFlMzFkZGIwYzkzYTVlYWRiNTMwOCxSYVZlUFlPcQ%3D%3D&b=t%3AQ8svKXOQOFn4j1wJ-IeWRA&p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weekinethereum.com%2Fpost%2F155174615803%2Foctober-30-2016&m=0) in a brief, low-key way.  I already listened to it but will probably go back and listen to it – in part to hear again the part where he talks about their next project with BHP Billiton.

- Iconomi’s token went live for trading – I happened to checkin and with much befuddlement saw it at 65m USD market cap. A few hours later it was at 14m.  At the moment it is slightly below 11m.
    - That pattern seems to be about normal in crypto token releases.

## What If We Had an (unofficial) US Ethereum Convention?

There are just a few hours left to get the early bird price (through midnight on Sunday).

Price goes up to $217 per ticket tonight at midnight. Tickets purchased this week are still refundable for any reason until 4 weeks before the conference.  

Discount Code: WHATSHAPPENING to get essentially the original price.   Discount code is good only on Monday and Tuesday.

So far we’ve had 20 registrants.   That’s pretty good for a conference 6 months away with no announced speakers.

\[Below is what I wrote in the last issue\]

What if we had an Ethereum convention in America?

When: March 2017, likely 3/9 - 3/10 \[halfway between DevCons\]

Where: Houston \[I live here, the weather is great in March, and it is United’s biggest hub so airfare is generally cheap\]

How long: 2 days, one night

Registration fee (during this week): $211.08

Already in?

What: A touch more ecosystem-focused than Devcons

Why:  During the last 3 Devcons (Berlin, London, Shanghai) I’ve been a little bummed not to go.  Shanghai was just too expensive and far away to justify, but I could have swung a domestic ticket and one night away from my kids. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there lots of other Americans who feel the same way.  But I guess we’ll found out from ticket sales.

I doubt that DevCon3 is going to be in the US, so I figured I’d try to organize my own.

Why should you buy tickets now?

1. Crowdfunding.  You want another Ethereum convention and you would be happy to attend in Houston in March when the weather is amazing.
2. Cheaper.  This week is the lowest price. Price is only going to go up after Oct 30th.
3. Refundable. Tickets purchased this week are refundable for any reason (up to two weeks before the conference starts).   Non-early bird ticket sales in future will not be refundable.

Plan

- For this week, I’m only going to publicize the event through this email.
- If there’s a lack of interest this week, then I’ll cancel the event and immediately refund in full those who did buy tickets.
- Next week’s registration fee will go up a small amount as it is marketed to the Ethereum community, though initially ticket sales will still be refundable.
- I expect non-early bird registration will be $300 and non-refundable.

Caveats:

- I’ve never organized a big convention.  I assume it will be tons of nailing down details.  Obviously my reputation will be on the line, so I will read as much as I can to prepare and then do my best.
- I haven’t yet started contacting speakers, as I’d like to know there is sufficient interest before booking speakers.
- If this event lacks sufficient interest, it will be cancelled and all ticket purchases will be immediately refunded.
- Sorry, no Ether option available – only credit cards accepted.  You’ll thank me 10 years in the future when you see what that Ether is worth then.
- Let me repeat: this is unofficial and in no way connected to the Ethereum Foundation

Still want in?
