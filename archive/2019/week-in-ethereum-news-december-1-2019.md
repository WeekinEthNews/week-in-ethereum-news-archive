I own 100% Week In Ethereum. Editorial control has always been me.

If you’re wondering “[why didn’t my post make it into Week in Ethereum](https://www.evanvanness.com/post/179914035841/why-didnt-my-post-make-the-newsletter),” then here’s a hint: don’t email me. Do put it on Reddit.

It’s amazing to me how many people email me when every issue has a link at the bottom saying not to email me to get in the newsletter.

If you're unhappy with editorial decisions or anything that I have written in this issue, feel free to [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness).
