- Missed this back then: in June, Jeffrey Berns closed the [deal to buy Kirkwood Bank of Nevada](https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/blockchains-ceo-charts-future-course-for-company-through-purchase-of-local-bank). So we should get another crypto-friendly bank, as promised at Devcon.
- For the 2nd straight week, I did an annotated version of the newsletter. Anyone who has bought the NFT can read it. Same link, you can still buy the NFT. See immediately below:

###### **🎂 3 year anniversary 🎂**

Just to repeat the advertisement immediately above: you can [buy the limited edition NFT for 0.11 Eth](https://weekinethereumnews.com/three-year-anniversary-edition/) which will unlock the annotated edition.

All proceeds will be back into Ethereum somehow, likely donated to a public good, at my discretion. And who knows, maybe there will be future benefits for the 200 NFT holders?

I own 100% Week In Ethereum. Editorial control has always been me.

If you’re wondering “[why didn’t my post make it into Week in Ethereum](https://www.evanvanness.com/post/179914035841/why-didnt-my-post-make-the-newsletter),” then here’s a hint: don’t email me. Do put it on Reddit. It’s amazing to me how many people email me when every issue has a link at the bottom saying not to email me to get in the newsletter.

If you're unhappy with editorial decisions or anything that I have written in this issue, feel free to [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/evan_van_ness).
