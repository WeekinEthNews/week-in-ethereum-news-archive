###### **Eth News and Links**

**Eth1**

- There’s an ongoing debate as to how much Eth1 should make breaking changes. In this instance, it’s about opcode repricing which might break code deployed on the chain, even though it is a bad practice to rely on static gas pricing. Sorpaas says [no breaking changes](https://twitter.com/sorpaas/status/1167154294551994369) please, though that’s opposed to the original sustainability movement which got mislabeled "eth1x." It’s not an easy debate in a decentralized ecosystem, though we have repriced opcodes before, because that’s necessary to avoid DoS attacks.
- Swende’s [1884 security considerations](https://github.com/holiman/eip-1884-security)
- ChainSecurity’s Hubert Ritzdorf analysis of [deployed code potentially affected by EIP1884](https://gist.github.com/ritzdorf/1c6bd72955391e831f8a397d3152b4e0)
- Swende [2046 benchmarking](https://github.com/holiman/goevmlab/tree/master/examples/callPrecompiles) in Geth. 2046 reduces cost of calls to precompiles
- an [EVM backend for LLVM](https://medium.com/etclabscore/the-evm-llvm-is-coming-to-ethereum-classic-what-you-need-to-know-c13962f25571) from ETC Labs Core
- [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone): fast EVM implementation in c++
- [Péter Szilágyi](https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1167414521935384578): “we have an experimental Geth full node weighing 139GB on #Ethereum mainnet: 94GB on HDD and 45GB on SSD. It's in sync”
- Parity [v2.6.2-beta](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.6.2) and [v2.5.7-stable](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-ethereum/releases/tag/v2.5.7) to fix a DoS attack of publicly exposed RPCs. Kudos to Amberdata for reporting.

**Eth2**

- Latest [What’s New in Eth2](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ChihChengLiang/Sk8Zs--CQ/https%3A%2F%2Fbenjaminion.xyz%2Fnewineth2%2F20190831.html?type=book)
- Latest [Eth2 implementers call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz87_i5Uy1I). [Mamy](https://gist.github.com/mratsim/b481ee7c598353298f111059d688be0c) and [Ben](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jA4H6uQvPsWYrOUGFJeQWqXzP6YUq6BFKfPYAI7_y3g/edit) both took notes.
- [Nimbus client](https://our.status.im/nimbus-berlin-update/) update - working on launch mechanics and interoperability.
- [Lodestar client](https://medium.com/chainsafe-systems/lodestar-update-c456534af215) update - BLS optimization, disc v5, and Eric Tu wrote the fastest JavaScript SHA256 implementation
- Spec [v0.8.3](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/releases/tag/v0.8.3) came out a week ago. updates to tests and networking.
- phase 1 spec has Sep 30th target date for completeness
- Some privacy proposals: [Privacy-Preserving Casper FFG using Traceable Ring Signatures](https://ethresear.ch/t/privacy-preserving-casper-ffg-using-traceable-ring-signatures/6054) and [ZKP to remove the mapping ip address / wallet’s public key of a validator](https://ethresear.ch/t/anonymity-a-zkp-to-remove-the-mapping-ip-address-wallets-public-key-of-a-validator/6049)
- EF released a list of [Eth2 grants](https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/08/26/announcing-ethereum-foundation-and-co-funded-grants/), focused on client teams and interop/networking, as well as some R&D for light clients and also for phase1 proof of custody. There are also 3 open bounties: phase 0 consensus, [Legendre PRF](https://legendreprf.org/bounties/), and [STARK friendly hash](https://starkware.co/hash-challenge/)
- [Danny Ryan talks Eth2](https://ethhub.substack.com/p/talking-ethereum-20-with-danny-ryan) on Into the Ether
- Rocketpool’s [second beta to test out decentralized Eth2 staking pools](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-2-v1-beta-launch-afc467c8195d)
- Vitalik’s list of [things that will change for app devs in Eth2](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1167510279736967168). This is not short-term planning but things to keep in mind for the future.

**Layer 2**

- FunFair founder Jeremy Longley with a detailed walkthrough of their [state channel architecture](https://funfair.io/a-reference-implementation-of-state-channel-contracts/) and code
- “[A unified state channel specification for Ethereum](http://statechannels.org/)” to lay “the foundation for a fully interoperable ecosystem” so that building on channels is as easy as possible for app devs
- AdEx: How we built the [largest payment channel network on Ethereum](https://gist.github.com/Ivshti/29552cdf20eda21191f7c795fd46de2a). 9 million transactions with only 13k USD onchain because they trigger a payment via channel for every ad impression. 10 cents in gas paid for millions of unidirectional, one-to-many payments. A good example of programmatic micropayments made possible by state channels.
- Raiden [light client v0.1](https://github.com/raiden-network/light-client/releases/tag/v0.1)
- Vitalik: the [dawn of hybrid layer 2](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/08/28/hybrid_layer_2.html)
- [Optimistic rollup](https://medium.com/plasma-group/ethereum-smart-contracts-in-l2-optimistic-rollup-2c1cef2ec537). Bonds/challenges to ensure valid transactions, instead of zk proofs, but easier to generalize for all applications and not just payments.

**Tokens / Business / Regulation**

- Synthetix: we were “dead wrong” in trying to [develop on centralized chains like EOS](https://blog.synthetix.io/cross-chain-infrastructure-revisited/) because Eth network effects are real. As Robert Leshner [notes](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1167621482324713472), “there are now more developers building on Compound Finance than there are developers building on either EOS or Tron.”
- Another Flippening: [Tether active addresses is multiples higher on Eth](https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/coin-metrics-state-of-the-network-fe8) than on BTC
- [NFTs are the “hello world!” of the internet of property](https://hackernoon.com/the-internet-of-property-is-here-hello-world-j72bk3uj0)

**General**

- Three DeFi newsletters worth tracking: Ryan Sean Adams’ [Bankless](https://bankless.substack.com), Camila Russo’s [The Defiant](https://thedefiant.substack.com/), and Nodar Janashia’s [DeFi tutorials](https://defitutorials.substack.com). Moar competition.
- [ETH DKG](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/985): distributed key generation from onchain code
- Vitalik: [quadratic voting with sortition](https://ethresear.ch/t/quadratic-voting-with-sortition/6065)
- For Week in Ethereum News’ 3 year anniversary, I did an annotated version of this week’s issue. Using [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/), you can view it by purchasing a limited edition [collectible NFT for the 3rd anniversary](https://weekinethereumnews.com/three-year-anniversary-edition/). Proceeds will be donated to things within the Ethereum ecosystem.

###### **🎂 3 year anniversary 🎂**

Just to repeat the advertisement immediately above: you can [buy the limited edition NFT for 0.11 Eth](https://weekinethereumnews.com/three-year-anniversary-edition/) which will unlock the annotated edition.

All proceeds will be back into Ethereum somehow, likely donated to a public good, at my discretion. And who knows, maybe there will be future benefits for the 200 NFT holders?
