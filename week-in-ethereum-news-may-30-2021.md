### **This newsletter is made possible thanks to NEAR’s [Aurora](https://aurora.dev/) EVM and Bridge!**

![Aurora](https://weekinethereumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/aurora-1024x341.jpeg)

Aurora is an Ethereum Layer-2 protocol that provides developers and users a seamless experience of Ethereum on top of [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/): a scalable, developer-friendly blockchain platform for decentralized applications. Aurora’s design allows base fees to be paid in ETH or other ERC-20s and enables all existing ETH wallets and other tools to work out of the box. Users don’t even need to leave their MetaMask wallet while using Aurora. 

The Aurora environment consists of the Aurora Engine, a high performance EVM, and the Aurora Bridge, facilitating trustless transfer of ETH and ERC20 tokens between Ethereum and Aurora, within a seamless, familiar user experience. Join top ETH projects such as 1inch & DODO in building the multi-chain future. Start using [Aurora](https://aurora.dev/about) to scale your Ethereum project now. 

Don’t forget to follow Aurora on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/auroraisnear) and join our [Telegram](https://t.me/auroraisnear).
