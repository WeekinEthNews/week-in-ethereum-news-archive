###### üéÇ **3 year anniversary** üéÇ

For the three year anniversary, we‚Äôre going to try a small experiment. ü•º

Next week I‚Äôm going to do two versions of the newsletter. One will be the normal edition, and one will be the gated ‚Äúannotated edition.‚Äù People often tell me they would be willing to pay money to get an edition with more commentary and with more robust summaries.

Partnering with [Unlock Protocol](https://unlock-protocol.com/), you can [buy the NFT for 0.11 Eth](https://weekinethereumnews.com/three-year-anniversary-edition/) which will unlock next week‚Äôs annotated edition. There are 200 Week in Ethereum 3 year anniversary NFTs available.

All proceeds will be back into Ethereum somehow, likely donated to a public good, at my discretion. And who knows, maybe there will be future benefits for the 200 NFT holders?
